# AT-Command-Playground-for-ESP32-C3-Dev-Kit-v2-and-STM32F030R8
Welcome to the **AT Command Playground** repository! This project demonstrates communication between the ESP32-C3 Dev Kit v2 and the STM32F030R8 Nucleo board using AT commands over UART. This playground serves as a foundational platform for learning, experimenting, and building projects involving Wi-Fi-enabled applications.
